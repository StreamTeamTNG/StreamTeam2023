Repository for 2022-2023 StreamTeamTNG members

In order to download this repository onto your computer, you can follow the instructions on this page: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?platform=mac&tool=webui.

Alternatively, you can press the green "Code" button on the main page of the repository and then press Download ZIP, which will download the entire repository onto your computer into a folder called "StreamTeam2023-main". 

Note that both these techniques will put all the data in the repository on your computer so be careful if the repository is very large (this will not be the case during this project).


Github is a very complex system with lots of capability. If you would like, you can look into pulling, pushing, branching, cloning, and other tools that Github has in place. Although you will likely not need all of those in the StreamTeam project, you will likely need to know about these if you plan on coding in your future research, so it can be helpful.
