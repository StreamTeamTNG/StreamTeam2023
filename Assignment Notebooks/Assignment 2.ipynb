    "As we have seen, streams are made up of stars that were once either dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. We can refer to either one of these as \"satellites\" that orbit the Milky Way. On those orbits, satellite stars are *tidally stripped*, forming streams. The stars are stripped when the \"pull\" from the host galaxy is stronger than the gravitational force within the satellite itself. When that happens to a star, it will separate from its satellite and become part of a stream of stars undergoing the same fate. THe overcoming of the gravitational force of the satellite on a given star will happen at a certain radius from the center of the satellite, called the *tidal radius*. The *tidal radius* at which stars are lost from the satellite is given by the formula $$r_{tide} \\sim (\\frac{m_{sat}}{M_{gal}})^{1/3} R$$"
